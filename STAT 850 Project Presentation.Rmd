## Baseball



## Slide with Bullets

- We originally wanted to set up a scouting report for every batter in the league, using some custom statistics derived from advanced batting statistics. We would then produce a heatmap and detailed scouting report of what sorts of pitches work on every batter, and where in the zone it worked. Gleefully, we set about finding our data.
- Our data exists, but isn't cheap. Back to the drawing board.
- Instead, we decided to see if we could predict the net number of wins a pitcher was worth based on his ERA (earned run average), OBP (Opponent On-base percentage), and whatever else could think of. We found a package called Lahman that would do the job.

## Slide with R Output

- Here, we're going to look at how we selected and in some cases created the column data we needed.
```{r error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(aod)
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(rbokeh)
library(quanteda)
library(Lahman)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Here, we look at the relevant data from Lahman

#Select columns from the Pitching dataset
pitchers <- select(tibble(Pitching), playerID, yearID, teamID, IPouts, BB, SO, BAOpp, ERA, W, L)


#Create a Net Wins column
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(NetWins = W-L)

#Only keep rows where there is no missing data
pitchers <- pitchers[complete.cases(pitchers),]

#Normalize data so that coefficients are meaningful
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(normIPouts = (IPouts - mean(IPouts)) / sd(IPouts))
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(normBB = (BB - mean(BB)) / sd(BB))
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(normSO = (SO - mean(SO)) / sd(SO))
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(normBAOpp = (BAOpp - mean(BAOpp)) / sd(BAOpp))
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(normERA = (ERA - mean(ERA)) / sd(ERA))
```

## Building linear model

-Finally, we can build our model, as is accomplished below.

```{r lm, echo=TRUE}

#Build Linear Model
mylm <- lm(NetWins ~ normIPouts + normBB + normSO + normBAOpp + normERA, data = pitchers)

#Analyze Findings
summary(mylm)
summary(mylm)$r.squared 

```

## Building a Generalized Additive Model

-That last model sucked. Let's try again with a better model.

```{r gam, include=TRUE}

#Note, these findings mean that our regression sucks. Trying a new regression.
mygam <- gam(NetWins ~ normIPouts + normBB + normSO + normBAOpp + normERA, data = pitchers)
summary(mygam)
summary(mygam)$r.squared

```

##Building a Generalized Linear Model

-That last model sucked too. Let's try another one--a generalized linear model.
```{r glm, include=TRUE}

#Note, these results also suck. Trying a new regression.
myglm <- glm(NetWins ~ normIPouts + normBB + normSO + normBAOpp + normERA, family = gaussian, data = pitchers)
summary(myglm)
summary(myglm)$r.squared
```

## Building models

-Wow, that went well. Let's see if we can figure out any kind of a model that works at all--even ones that are nonlinear and completely unintuitive to normal humans. 

-We're going to throw everything at it. We are inevitable.

-Put on that infinity glove and snap your fingers

```{r interaction, include=TRUE}

#Note, all of these results still suck. Going to try an interaction model with everything

#Select columns from the Pitching dataset
pitchers <- tibble(Pitching)

#Create a Net Wins column
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(NetWins = W-L)

#Only keep rows where there is no missing data
pitchers <- pitchers[complete.cases(pitchers),]



#mylm <- lm(NetWins ~ IPouts*HR*BB*SO*BAOpp*ERA*IBB*WP*HBP*BK*BFP*GIDP, data = pitchers)

#Analyze Findings
#summary(mylm)
#summary(mylm)$r.squared 
```

## After the MCU

- Well look at that, we snapped our fingers and explained just over half of the variation. Excellent work team!

- Clearly, this isn't going as well as it might've. We decided to look at a crossplot of what sorts of correlation exists.

## Crossplot

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Crossplot Matrix.png')
```


## Interesting Things

To me, the most interesting thing was strikeouts by OBP, so I made an interactive graph.

## Interactive OBP x Strikeouts

```{r interactive graph, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE }

#Read in data, cast as tibble
pitchers <-  read_csv("stats.csv")
pitchers <- tibble(pitchers)

pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(name=paste(first_name, last_name))

pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(name=paste(first_name, last_name))

pitchers <- pitchers[order(pitchers$player_age),]

pitchers <- pitchers[order(pitchers$name),]

colnames(pitchers)[colnames(pitchers) == "player_age"] <- "Player Age"
colnames(pitchers)[colnames(pitchers) == "name"] <- "Name"
colnames(pitchers)[colnames(pitchers) == "year"] <- "Year"
colnames(pitchers)[colnames(pitchers) == "p_strikeout"] <- "Strikeouts"
colnames(pitchers)[colnames(pitchers) == "p_walk"] <- "Walks"
colnames(pitchers)[colnames(pitchers) == "on_base_percent"] <- "OBP"


#Add an empty column that we can populate in the next chunk
emptycolumn <- c("Years_In_Pitching")
pitchers[ , emptycolumn] <- NA


pitchers$Years_In_Pitching[1]<-1

i<-2
while (i < length(pitchers$Years_In_Pitching)){
  if(i==1){
    pitchers$Years_In_Pitching[i]=1
    i=i+1
    }
  else if(pitchers$Name[i]==pitchers$Name[i-1]){
    pitchers$Years_In_Pitching[i]=pitchers$Years_In_Pitching[i-1]+1
    i=i+1
    }
  else if(pitchers$Name[i]!=pitchers$Name[i-1]){
    pitchers$Years_In_Pitching[i] = 1
    i=i+1
  }
}

pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(decade = (Year %/% 10)*10)
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(Decade = format(decade, digits = 4))


figure(width = 800, height = 500) %>%
  ly_points(x = OBP, y = Strikeouts, color = Decade,
  data = pitchers, hover = list(Name, Year, OBP, Strikeouts))

```
